REciNK - Rethink Continuous Integration for JavaScript Applications
===================================================================

[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/recink.svg?maxAge=0)](https://npmjs.org/package/recink)

REciNK was born from our need to automate the execution of JavaScript tests.
We quickly realized that we need to RETHINK (aka `REciNK`) entire Continuous
Integration process for JavaScript applications. Similar to `.travis.yml`, we
empower developers to simply drop the `.recink.yml` config file into GitHub
repository and follow below Getting Started guide to use it as part of their
Continuous Integration pipeline (maybe even extend to Continuous Deployment).

- [x] Node.js >= v6.x
- [x] NPM >= v3.x

> Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to install and
manage different versions of Node.js; Ideally, use v8+ for faster performance


# Installation

`npm install -g recink`


# Getting Started

@See [User Guide](https://github.com/MitocGroup/recink/blob/master/docs/guide.md#configuring-github-project)


# Usage

```shell
recink run unit [path]                 # Run unit tests                              
recink run e2e [path]                  # Run end to end tests                        
recink configure recink [path]         # Configure REciNK                            
recink configure travis [path]         # Configure Travis                            
recink travis encrypt [path]           # Encrypt Travis environment variables        
recink travis lint [path]              # Lint Travis configuration                   
recink component generate [path]       # Generate REciNK boilerplate component       
recink component add [name...]         # Add an REciNK component to the registry     
recink component remove [name...]      # Remove an REciNK component from the registry
recink component list                  # List REciNK components from the registry    
recink help <command>                  # Display help for a specific command   
```


# Debugging

To enable debug mode for [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) use `DEBUG=* recink run unit`.

[TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe) offers amazing debugging capabilities
[documented here](http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/test-api/debugging.html).

We use [Nighmare](https://github.com/ryx/testcafe-browser-provider-nightmare)
as default browser, which provides native debugging capabilities
[documented here](https://github.com/ryx/testcafe-browser-provider-nightmare#debugging).

> Use `-v` flag to enable verbose mode on any `recink` command.
