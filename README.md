`reCInk` (former `run-jst`) is a highly customizable and extremely optimized tests runner
suitable for running tests on big / hybrid / complex projects by adding a simple `.recink.yml` config.

# Motivation

Finding an highly configurable test runner that suits for more than a basic js app
is as hard as writing high quality tests :bowtie:. The main reason is getting test running as fast as possible
with a minimal headache possible and extending the runner via components using a simple and documented api.

Also CI integration and caching out of the box :wink:

> The project has been started to cover the needs of [Deep Ecosystem](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework)
